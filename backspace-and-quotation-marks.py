"""
In which I try to utilize the backspace function so I can add punctuation next to a variable without there being a space!

Placing a + directly after a variable skips the space and lets you put whatever you want directly after it
e.g.
Input:
	var = Ryan
	print(var + ".")
Output:
	Ryan.

Placing a forward slash in front of a quotation mark allows you to place it inside a printed statement
e.g.
Input:
	print("\"Nice to meet you.\"")
Output:
	"Nice to meet you."
